# Knowledge Mapping and Data Visualization Project
### Data knowledge visualization term project.
### This project is developed by Alper Doğukan Nizamoğlu.

# *What Is The Project Topic ?*

### Covid-19 impact on violence against women

# *PART A*

## *Problem Definition*

### Covid-19, which is one of the biggest pandemics in world history, which has affected the whole world since the first case news from China, has also unfortunately affected many aspects of human life negatively. In addition to greatly restricting human life in the social sense, it also caused enormous financial damage to both private sector employees and public institutions in economic terms and caused massive layoffs. 

### Although people in developed countries have survived this period a little more easily, the situation in developing and underdeveloped countries is at the level of disaster. In addition to its negative impact on ongoing activities, especially in underdeveloped and developing countries, it has worsened the chronic problems of these countries. Violence against women comes at the forefront of the chronic problems of these countries, and the main subject of this project is the increase in violence against women during the covid-19 period and its reasons.

## *Why This Topic ?*

### I chose this topic for my project because I think the issue of violence against women is ignored even though it is in front of people every day, especially in our country, the horror of this situation is increasing day by day.

# *PART B*

## *Where Did You Get The Data ?*

### I got this data from the websites that collects data sets and the other person or organizations that interested in this topic like me 

## *What Challenges Did You Face In Preparing The Data ?*

### In fact, the process of finding data was more difficult than I thought, because I had to visit dozens of sites and read articles to find the data sets and statistics I was looking for. The fact that there are so few data sets on the internet on this subject is just as upsetting. I had a little difficulty finding what I was looking for, not only data on violence against women, but also the way in which violence was used against women, as I was looking for data sets with the level of affiliation of the perpetrators with the women in question and their characteristics.
