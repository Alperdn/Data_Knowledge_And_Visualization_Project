Covid-19 impact on violence against women

## *Problem Definition*

Covid-19, which is one of the biggest pandemics in world history, which has affected the whole world since the first case news from China, has also unfortunately affected many aspects of human life negatively. In addition to greatly restricting human life in the social sense, it also caused enormous financial damage to both private sector employees and public institutions in economic terms and caused massive layoffs. 

Although people in developed countries have survived this period a little more easily, the situation in developing and underdeveloped countries is at the level of disaster. In addition to its negative impact on ongoing activities, especially in underdeveloped and developing countries, it has worsened the chronic problems of these countries. Violence against women comes at the forefront of the chronic problems of these countries, and the main subject of this project is the increase in violence against women during the covid-19 period and its reasons.
