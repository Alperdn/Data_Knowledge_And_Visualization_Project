The biggest impact of Covid-19 on our lives is undoubtedly that it restricts our social life, 
the hygiene rules we need to follow must be very strict to avoid this virus, but even though the virus affects our lives in this way, 
our basic needs, household needs and the need for shopping are definitely not over. Although the need for cargo has been increasing regularly, 
online market ordering applications, which were considered unnecessary by a certain segment until a few years ago, became very popular in this period. 
For example, the Turkish company named Getir is one of the companies that had the most profitable period of this period, and its opening abroad is a proof that supports this example. 
In this period, cargo and online grocery shopping practices have increased so much that even if life returns to normal, it is predicted that the need for these services will not end, 
and in this period, where people mostly meet their clothing needs with cargo companies, they will now meet their grocery shopping needs with online market applications. 
For these reasons, I will prepare a project about the impact of the pandemic process on cargo and online market applications.
